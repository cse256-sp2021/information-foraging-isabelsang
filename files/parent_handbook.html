        Below you will find a few key points from the <a class="download" href="downloads/parent_handbook.pdf">Parent Handbook</a>, including our approaches to communication, assessment, discipline, and extra help.
      </h2>
      <h2>Communication with Parents</h2>
       <p>Communication	is	ongoing	throughout	the	year.		Newsletters,	the	school	website	and	emails	
          give	you	information	on	current	themes,	activities	and	upcoming	events.		Phone	calls	and/or	
          emails	by	classroom	teachers	to	discuss	your	child’s	adjustment,	observations	and/or	
          concerns	are	common.		If	you	feel	you	need	to	speak	to	a	teacher	or	the	director,	please	email	
          or	call	the	office.		Teachers	can	be	reached	by	phone	or	email	after	the	school	day	is	over.</p>
      <h2>Assessing and Sharing Children's Knowledge with Parent-Teacher Conferences</h2>
          <p>Assessment	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.	Teachers	interact	with	children	in	their	play,	
              conversations	and	observations	both	in	the	classrooms	and	during	outdoor	play.	Teachers keep	notes	on	each	child,	writing	about	strengths	and	weaknesses	in	all	areas	of	their	
              development.	Assessment	includes	checklists,	timelines	and	examples	of	the	children’s	
              writings	and	pictures.	Teaching	teams	meet	weekly	to	discuss	each	child	and	plan	activities	
              in	their	program	to	enhance	needed	skills	for	children.	</p>
              <p>The	school	has	two	Parent	Conferences	during	the	school	year.	The	fall	conference	is	an
              informal,	getting-to-know-the-child-and-family	discussion.	The	spring	conference	includes a	
              more	detailed,	written	assessment.	A	parent-teacher	conference	can	be	scheduled	at	any	
              time	during	the	year	as	needed	and	by	request	of	parents	and/or	teachers.</p>
        <h2>Discipline</h2>
        <p>The	staff	is	trained	to	anticipate	potentially	problematic	situations;	they	remind	children	of	
            appropriate	behavior	and	redirect	or	intervene	when	necessary.		In	most	cases,	teachers	can	
            stop	or	re-direct	behavior	before	something	negative	occurs.		If	not,	teachers	will	first	consult	
            the	injured	party	to	make	sure	they	are	emotionally	and	physically	okay.		Then,	they	will	turn	
            their	attention	to	the	child	who	might	need	more	support	in	“keeping	their	friends	safe”	or,	
            more	likely,	“keeping	their	bodies	safe”	with	others.		Reflection	over	what	has	occurred	will	
            lead	to	discovering	other	behavior	options	and	resolving	things	with	the	peer.
        </p><p>
            Encouragement	and	pride	in	self	is	the	basis	of	our	discipline	policy.	Our	aim	is	to	have	the	
            children	manage	their	own	actions	and	reactions.	The	teachers	and	staff	will	help	children	
            learn	and	develop	skills	that	they	need	to	display	appropriate	behavior.			This	is	done	
            through:
            • Positive	reinforcement.
            • Anticipating	unhealthy	social	interaction.
            • Re-direction:		guiding	a	child	toward	appropriate,	socially	positive	activities.
            • Naming	and	validating	child’s	feelings
            • Expressing	disappointment	or	disapproval	in a	respectful	and	constructive	manner.
            • Simple,	logical	and	immediate	consequences.</p>
    <h2>Extra Help</h2>
            <p>If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety
                    of ways, which may include:
            <ul id ="extra-help">
                <li>Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking
                        process, build trust, and increase student confidence</li>
                <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
                <li>Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli</li>
                <li>Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</li>
                <li>Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in
                        order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process</li>
                <li>Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular
                        concept, skill, or area of concern</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
