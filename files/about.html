                        The Washington University Nursery School was founded in 1947 as a
                        cooperative venture of faculty and Washington University in St.
                        Louis. The primary purpose of the nursery school is to provide the
                        highest quality preschool program for children 2 years and 7
                        months to 5 years of age. Today about 70 percent of the children
                        are from families of Washington University in St. Louis faculty,
                        staff and students, and the remaining are from families in the
                        community.</i>

                        Children come from a variety of countries, cultures and
                        economic
                        backgrounds.&nbsp;The school maintains the high standards of the
                        National Association for the Education of Young Children, by
                        which&nbsp;it&nbsp;is accredited. It is licensed by the State of
                        Missouri.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The nursery school also serves as a site for research in child
                        development and early childhood teacher training. Washington
                        University undergraduate and graduate students are employed to
                        assist in the classrooms. The classroom teachers, as well as the
                        nursery school’s director, supervise them. The student workers’
                        presence enables children to receive additional individual
                        attention.

                    <p>
                        The nursery school is located on the Washington University campus.
                        It is composed of three classrooms which are designed to offer
                        children a variety of choices in their play. Two additional
                        all-purpose rooms are equipped with a library and a variety of
                        indoor gross motor play materials.&nbsp;A large outdoor play area
                        gives children the opportunity to run, bike, swing, climb, slide
                        and play in the sand.

                    <h1>We go the extra mile... Extra Help</h1>
                    <p>If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety
                            of ways, which may include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking
                                process, build trust, and increase student confidence</li>
                        <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
                        <li>Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli</li>
                        <li>Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</li>
                        <li>Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in
                                order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process</li>
                        <li>Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular
                                concept, skill, or area of concern</li>

                            I cannot say enough good things about WUNS. We feel extremely
                            lucky to have discovered your nursery school. The staff is
                            dedicated, well-trained and (most of all) cares deeply for the
                            children. The other families are warm and welcoming, and their
                            diversity will hopefully serve as a baseline for...what the
                            world should look like.

                            It’s wonderful to feel like your child’s caregivers are better
                            at the job than you are; truly, on the whole they are more
                            patient, better able to see the forest for the trees, certainly
                            more trained and aware of what’s developmentally appropriate

                            There are many benefits, but problem-solving and being a good
                            friend are two of the important things our child is learning at
                            WUNS. In small ways–through play, stories, outings, activities
                            and pictures–there is so much learning taking place at WUNS
                            (great for all abilities and learning styles). WUNS is a diverse
                            environment with many opportunities to learn about other
                            cultures, customs, foods and traditions that our (child) most
                            likely wouldn’t have been exposed to elsewhere.

                            teachers every day. I feel that the teachers helped my child
                            build self-confidence and improve his language skills. I am 100%
