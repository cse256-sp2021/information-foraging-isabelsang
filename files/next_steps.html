      <p>This	visiting	day	is	usually	the	day	after	Labor	Day	and	gives	the	child	and	parent(s) an	
          opportunity	to	visit	the	classroom	and	meet	the	teachers	and	classmates.		This	visit	is	one	
          hour.		It	will	allow	time	for	the	child	to	enjoy	free	play	and	also	gives	parent(s) a	brief	
          overview	of what	to	expect	during	the	school	year.
          </p>
      <p>The	next	day, a	child	will	attend school on	his/her own	(either	Wednesday	or	Thursday).		The	class	is	divided	in	half,	attending	on	either	Wednesday or	
          Thursday.		This	schedule	allows	the	children	and	teachers	to	interact	with	a	small	group	
          before the	entire	class	attends	on	Friday.</p>
